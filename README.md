Eneba assignment:
1) How to view the live app
   - First open "https://eneba-backend-d6gl.onrender.com/list" and wait till the backend gives data, calling the url wakes up the backend(Render free version is used for this app, and the backend spins down after a few seconds of inactivity)
   - Then use this link(https://eneba-assignment-pydx.onrender.com) to view the live app one the backend showed the data
     
2) Issues I am working on:
   - Responsive design: ability to use the app on different screen sizes.

     
Final output:
